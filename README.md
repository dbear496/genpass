# GenPass

This is a work-in-progress re-implementation of my original Bash script in C++.
I have big plans for this re-work including a QT GUI interface, Windows
compatibility, and password generation with a proper NIST-approved MAC.

The repository for the original GenPass, a.k.a. GenPass-Bash, has been moved to
https://github.com/dbear496/genpass-bash .
